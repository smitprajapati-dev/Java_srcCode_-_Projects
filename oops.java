// OOP has several advantages over procedural programming:
// *oop is faster and easier to excute
// * oop provides a clear strectures for the programs.
// * OOP helps to keep  the java code DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself), and makes code easier to maintain, modify and debug
// * OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time
